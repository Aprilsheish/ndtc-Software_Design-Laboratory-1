  <h3 style="color: khaki;">Origin</h3>
  <br />French fries (North American English), chips (British English and
  other national varieties),[1] finger chips (Indian English),[2] french-fried
  potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut[3] deep-fried
  potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium and France. They are prepared by
  cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in
  a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used,
  and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small
  convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.

<p>French fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the 19th century. In Germany, they are usually known by the French words pommes frites, or only Pommes or Fritten (derived from the French words, but pronounced as German words).[46] Often served with ketchup or mayonnaise, they are popular as a side dish in restaurants, or as a street-food snack purchased at an Imbissstand (snack stand). Since the 1950s, currywurst has become a widely-popular dish that is commonly offered with fries. Currywurst is a sausage (often bratwurst or bockwurst) in a spiced ketchup-based sauce, dusted with curry powder.[47]
        The standard deep-fried cut potatoes in the United Kingdom are called chips, and are cut into pieces between 10 and 15 mm (0.39 and 0.59 in) wide. They are occasionally made from unpeeled potatoes (skins showing). British chips are not the same thing as potato chips (an American term); those are called "crisps" in the UK and some other countries. In the UK, chips are part of the popular, and now international, fast food dish fish and chips. In the UK, chips are considered a separate item to french fries. Chips are a thicker cut than french fries, they are generally cooked only once and at a lower temperature.[48][49][50] From 1813 on, recipes for deep-fried cut potatoes occur in popular cookbooks.[51] By the late 1850s, at least one cookbook refers to "French Fried Potatoes".[52]
        The first commercially available chips in the UK were sold by Mrs 'Granny' Duce in one of the West Riding towns in 1854.[53] A blue plaque in Oldham marks the origin of the fish-and-chip shop, and thus the start of the fast food industry in Britain.[54] In Scotland, chips were first sold in Dundee: "in the 1870s, that glory of British gastronomy – the chip – was first sold by Belgian immigrant Edward De Gernier in the city's Greenmarket".[55] In Ireland the first chip shop was "opened by Giuseppe Cervi", an Italian immigrant, "who arrived there in the 1880s".[56] It was estimated in 2011 that in the UK, 80% of households bought frozen chips each year.[57] Although chips were a popular dish in most Commonwealth countries, the "thin style" french fries have been popularised worldwide in large part by the large American fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King.[58]
